# Release Notes: v0.2.4 - SQLite Database Integration

## Overview

Version 0.2.4 of the Context-Extended AI Software Development Agent enhances data persistence and integrity by migrating both project and session storage to SQLite. This significant architectural improvement provides a robust foundation for maintaining complex relationships between projects, sessions, and code fragments, while ensuring data integrity and improving query performance.

## Key Features

### SQLite-Based Project Storage
- Complete relational database schema for projects, tags, and files
- Automatic migration from YAML files to SQLite with backup preservation
- Enhanced search and filtering capabilities for projects
- Improved metadata storage and retrieval
- Transaction support for better data integrity

### Enhanced Session Management
- Persistent tracking of active sessions across command invocations
- Efficient history tracking for commands and their results
- Better relationship modeling between sessions and projects
- More robust error handling and data validation
- Improved context persistence between operations

### Integration Improvements
- Consistent storage architecture for all persistent data
- Seamless connection between project and session data
- More efficient queries for related data
- Better support for concurrent operations
- Improved performance for large datasets

## Detailed Changes

### Database Schema
- **Projects Table**: Core project information
- **Project Tags Table**: Many-to-many relationship for project tags
- **Project Files Table**: Files associated with projects
- **Sessions Table**: Session metadata and content
- **Active Session Table**: Tracks which session is currently active

### Enhanced Operations
- **Project Management**: Create, update, search, and delete projects with proper relational integrity
- **File Tracking**: Add and manage files within projects with metadata
- **Session Persistence**: Maintain active sessions across multiple command invocations
- **Command History**: Track and query command history within sessions
- **Context Values**: Store and retrieve context information persistently

### Migration Path
- Automatic migration of existing YAML-based projects to SQLite
- Preservation of original YAML files as backups
- Seamless transition for existing projects and workflows

## Installation & Upgrade

Current users can upgrade with:

```bash
git pull
chmod +x project_manager.py session_manager.py
```

The SQLite database will be automatically created at `~/.devagent/devagent.db` and existing projects will be migrated.

## Example Usage

```bash
# Project commands remain the same
devagent project create "API Project" --tags api python

# Create a session for a project
devagent session create "Development" --project-id api-project

# Command history is now tracked automatically
devagent search "authentication"
devagent generate "Create a JWT authentication function" --output auth.py

# View session history
devagent session history

# Close and later resume the session
devagent session close
devagent session load <session-id>
```

## What's Next

Future development will focus on:
- Code quality assessment and metrics
- Automated testing integration
- Performance optimization for large projects
- Enhanced user experience for common workflows

## Notes

- The SQLite database is located at `~/.devagent/devagent.db`
- A backup of your original projects.yaml is preserved as `~/.devagent/projects.yaml.bak`
- This release completes Phase 3's data persistence components
- For complete documentation, see the updated README.md
