# Release Notes v0.2.0 - Context Extension with RAG

## Overview

This release marks the completion of Phase 2 of the Context-Extended AI Software Development Agent POC. We've successfully implemented a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that enables AI-assisted code generation with awareness of the broader codebase context. This represents a significant step toward our goal of creating an AI agent that can understand and work across large Python projects.

## Key Features Added

### Vector Database (Qdrant)
- Added Qdrant container for efficient vector storage
- Implemented collections for code fragments and project metadata
- Created APIs for storing, retrieving, and managing code semantics

### Code Embeddings
- Integrated Sentence Transformers with all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model
- Added support for embedding code at function, class, and module levels
- Implemented semantic search for code fragments

### RAG Framework
- Created a complete RAG pipeline using LlamaIndex
- Integrated with LiteLLM for communicating with Ollama models
- Implemented context-aware code generation
- Added support for multi-file code context retrieval

### Testing & Utilities
- Comprehensive test scripts for each component
- Example code for data science workflows
- Commands for managing the vector database
- Direct API access for code generation

## Technical Details

### Docker Integration
- Qdrant container with persistent storage
- Proper network configuration for inter-service communication
- Resource limits optimized for systems with 4GB RAM

### Python Components
- qdrant_helper.py: Utilities for vector database management
- code_rag.py: RAG framework for context-aware generation
- test scripts for validating functionality

### Compatibility
- Works with Ollama's codellama and llama2 models
- Supports Python 3.8+ environments
- Optimized for Debian-based systems

## Example Use Cases

1. **Code Generation with Context**: Generate new functions that integrate with existing components
2. **Semantic Code Search**: Find relevant code fragments based on natural language queries
3. **Context-Aware Documentation**: Generate documentation informed by the broader codebase

## Known Limitations

- Currently focused on Python code only
- Requires a separate Ollama service
- Limited to the context window of the underlying LLM

## What's Next

Phase 3 will focus on:
- Building a unified CLI interface
- Implementing autonomous coding workflows
- Adding project management features
- Enhancing context handling for larger codebases
