# Release Notes: v0.2.5 - Session Management and Context Fixes

## Overview

Version 0.2.5 of the Context-Extended AI Software Development Agent focuses on fixing critical bugs in the session management and context awareness systems. This release addresses several important issues that affected the reliability and integrity of the development sessions and project metadata, ensuring a more seamless and dependable experience when working with complex projects.

## Key Fixes

### Session Management
- Fixed auto-session creation for commands requiring context awareness
- Corrected the handling of command history to properly respect session creation time
- Implemented missing conversation context retrieval for meta-queries
- Improved session persistence and reliability

### Project Management
- Fixed project deletion to properly clean up associated tags
- Resolved unique constraint violations when recreating projects with the same name and tags
- Enhanced project metadata integrity during CRUD operations

### Redis Connectivity
- Added proper environment variables for Redis configuration
- Fixed connectivity issues in the context selection system
- Improved error handling and fallback mechanisms
- Enhanced logging for better diagnostics

## Improvements

### Enhanced Context Selection
- Properly implemented conversation meta-query handling
- Fixed code structure extraction and analysis
- Improved context relevance for queries about previous interactions
- Better handling of session history for context-aware responses

### Environment Integration
- Added comprehensive environment variable handling for Redis
- Simplified configuration approach for better maintainability
- Improved integration between Docker and non-Docker environments

## Installation & Upgrade

Current users can upgrade with:

```bash
git pull
```

The Redis configuration can now be easily customized through environment variables in the `.env` file:

```

REDIS_PORT=6379
REDIS_PASSWORD=
REDIS_DB=0
REDIS_CACHE_EXPIRY=86400
```

## What's Next

Future development will focus on:
- Enhanced vector embedding for better code similarity detection
- Performance optimizations for large projects
- Advanced code generation with improved context utilization
- Extended testing with complex real-world projects

## Notes

- This release completes the bug fixes identified in ISSUES.md
- All critical session management and project integrity issues have been resolved
- The system now handles conversation meta-queries correctly
